# HTML-CSS Task

This is a small task where I've developed 3 pages of a website with navigational bar & a footer consisting in the home page of the webiste. <br>
I've created a simple website about backpack and have made up a, <br>
* Home page
* About Page
* Backpack Page

# Home Page:

I've made use of a navigational bar at the very top of the page.<br>
Below that, is a paragraph tag where I've feeded some text along with an image with the img tag.<br>
I, also, enhanced some tags of the page with css, for instance, div tag.
Finally, I've implemented a footer at the end of the page feeding a href of "email" and have not initiated the tag.

# About Page:

After the home page, I went along with about-us page where I told what the page title describes.<br>
* Terminolgy
* Backpack Designs
* Daily use
I've not made use of any other tags of html except h2, ul, li(list items), p tags.
  
# Backpack Page:

As moving forward, finally developing the last page or tab of the website.<br>
Created the backpack page listing various types of backpacks and fetched information abour each type.<br>
In this page, I've made of various tags. style tag, h2, ol, li(list items), p, img.<br>

While developing this project, I helped myself for the contents of the website & various pages through wikipedia
